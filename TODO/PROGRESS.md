Current work lives here; [INDEX.md](INDEX.md) owns the entry list and
[RULES.md](RULES.md) owns standing policy. History is in git and the entries.

## Active work

⭐ **The session resumed `WSL-67` from the operator's checkpoint and works unattended.**
Driving its provider profiles found `WSL-85`, which the operator approved in chat, and it
is closed. `WSL-67`'s provider-profile cases are in the acceptance runner and pass.
**Next:** `WSL-67`'s `pkgin` and `pkg_add` drives once the operator approves the two image
downloads, then its closing with three reviews; `WSL-70` and `WSL-71` meanwhile, and
after it.

⚠ **The two BSD image downloads wait for the operator's approval in chat.** Asked on
2026-09-15 at the session's start, naming each file, its source and its size, and not
yet answered. ⭐ QEMU 11.1.0 here puts SeaBIOS's screen on the serial console with `-M
q35,graphics=off`, measured with no disk on 2026-09-15, which is how a BSD boot loader's
prompt is reached with no `sga` device.

`WSL-78`'s entry point, `base agent` and the `muse.exe` launcher remain built and
driven without a sign-in.

## The work order, set by the operator on 2026-09-14

Each entry's section in [`wsl-toolkit-go.md`](wsl-toolkit-go.md) carries its
premise, decisions and prove. An issue closes only when every entry mapped to it
is closed, and the issue gets a comment naming the commits.

1. ⭐ **Closed:** `WSL-74`, `WSL-80`, `WSL-79` with issue 33, `WSL-75`, `WSL-81`,
   `WSL-72`, `WSL-77`, `WSL-84`, `WSL-83`, `WSL-82` and `WSL-85`.
2. **Finish issue 30's existing package and profile work:** `WSL-67`, then `WSL-70`,
   then `WSL-71`. `WSL-67` has left: driving `pkgin` and `pkg_add`, which waits for
   the operator's approval of the two downloads, and its closing.
3. **`WSL-68`, the sealed base: a dedicated session of its own.** It closes issue
   30 after the work above, and uses the drive verifier `WSL-84` fixed.
4. **Muse and herdr together, one dedicated session.** Build `wsl-toolkit-base` from
   [`../tools/windows/wsl-toolkit/examples/muse-code/wsl-toolkit-base.json`](../tools/windows/wsl-toolkit/examples/muse-code/wsl-toolkit-base.json);
   the operator runs `muse login` in it; then close `WSL-76` and `WSL-78`. Author
   approved entries for `pi` and `omp` before either adapter is built.
5. **`wsl-toolkit-v3.0.0`** is cut after issues 30 and 32 are closed, and CI is green
   on the final commit.

## Rulings in force

1. **2026-09-13: herdr replaces Zellij** as the agents' multiplexer, and tmux
   stays a generic fallback. `WSL-76` quotes the operator.
2. **2026-09-14: one base for every agent.** `wsl-toolkit-base`, the instance
   `base`, configured under the operator's account, with the Linux account
   `herdr`, passwordless sudo and no standing grant. Test grants name directories
   under this repository's `.tmp`. In `WSL-75`.
3. **2026-09-14, the entries' decisions:** `WSL-75` live grants of a project or of
   a parent directory; `WSL-76` OpenSSH through `wsl.exe` with nothing listening
   and only the herdr client's key accepted, and herdr's background checks left
   on; `WSL-77` adapters in the tree with a generated embedded copy; `WSL-78`
   agents run in the base and Windows gets launchers; `WSL-68` the internet only
   with the host refused, and only with no rule in the shared network namespace;
   `WSL-67` drive `pkgin` and `pkg_add`, and remove a manager that cannot be driven
   here.
4. **2026-09-14: one Muse installer digest is approved**, `5196d820…632a0ca`, in
   `WSL-77`.
5. **2026-09-14: host changes the agent may make:** a dedicated SSH key and one
   marked `Host` block in `%USERPROFILE%\.ssh\config`, and agent launchers in
   `%USERPROFILE%\bin`.
6. **2026-09-14: cut `wsl-toolkit-v3.0.0` only after the order above is complete.**
   Issues 30 and 32 are closed first. Run `repo release` read-only, and publish only
   with CI green on the final commit.
7. **2026-09-14: finish existing work before Muse and herdr.** Keep Muse and herdr
   together in one later dedicated session. Complete the sealed base before it. In
   `WSL-76`.
8. **2026-09-14: remove Soar and keep Nix**, and Nix is loaded, set up and never
   installed: an installed Nix is found without sourcing a profile, flakes are set up
   and used for a new profile, the four `NIXPKGS_ALLOW_*` variables are always on
   with more defaults where they help, and a GitHub token reaches Nix through
   `NIX_CONFIG` only. All of it lives in this repository. In `WSL-67`.
9. **2026-09-15: `WSL-85` approved**, "approve WSL-85": filed and fixed in this
   session, before `WSL-70`.

## Before every push

A green local gate is not CI. Run the Go tests with `TEMP` and `TMP` at an 8.3
short path, then CI's Linux Go job and its ShellCheck in containers.
[`../tools/windows/wsl-toolkit/README.md`](../tools/windows/wsl-toolkit/README.md)
carries all three as commands under "Build and local proof". ⚠ **A BSD run no longer
writes the shared image**, so a heavy run may boot it; a run that needs a damaged or
altered image goes on a copy, with `WSL_TOOLKIT_CACHE` under this repository's `.tmp`.
⚠ **An untracked script is outside CI's ShellCheck command**, which lists `git
ls-files`, so check a new one by name before it is added.

## Recent work

| commit | what |
| --- | --- |
| `45fc7cc` | `WSL-67` partial: Soar removed from `bootstrap.sh`; the Nix route finds an installed Nix, sets up flakes and installs through the table's `nix` key; the last session's record and summary |
| `953e7b8` | `WSL-85` filed and closed: the verifier refuses passwordless sudo the configuration turned off, `base ensure` provisions such a base again, and a verification failure is named past wsl.exe's own lines; 3 mutation rows |
| the `WSL-67` acceptance commit | `WSL-67` partial: the acceptance runner builds `wsl-toolkit-accp` and drives the two provider profiles as five cases, 96 of 96 in a full run |

## Measurements

On Windows 11 Pro 26200, WSL 2.7.12, on 2026-09-15:

- **At the start of this session:** the doctor exit 0 in 37.62 s at 00:40:58Z; the
  gate exit 0, 20 checks green in 37.47 s at 00:41:42Z; `wsl -l -v` matched the host
  state below; CI run 34869369358 for `45fc7cc` was green.
- **For `WSL-85`:** on the throwaway `wsl-toolkit-p67`, a sudo drift made `base status
  --probe` exit 1 in 0.5 s and `base ensure` provision again in 15.9 s and 16.0 s; a
  rule the tool did not write made `base ensure` exit 2 in 14.5 s. The Go suites green:
  305 top-level `wsl-toolkit` cases on Windows with `TEMP` at the 8.3 path, 297 passed,
  8 skipped; 304 in `golang:1.25`, 303 passed, 1 skipped. ShellCheck 0.9.0 in
  `ubuntu:24.04` clean over 34 tracked scripts.
- **For `WSL-67`'s provider profiles, on `wsl-toolkit-p67`:** a build from nothing with
  automount and interop off, systemd, the developer toolset and one read-write grant
  under `.tmp` took 67.3 s. As the account: the grant the one DrvFS mount beside WSL's
  own `/usr/lib/wsl/drivers`, a sentinel read and a file written back to Windows, no
  `/mnt` drive, no interop, systemd PID 1, `mount -t drvfs C:` refused. Zero grants: the
  probe exit 1 naming the stale mount, and `base ensure` removed it in 20.4 s. `base
  grant` and `base revoke` 0.31 s and 0.29 s.
- **For `WSL-67`'s acceptance cases:** the five alone 5 of 5 in 105.1 s, and red over a
  build with `WSL-85`'s check taken out; the full runner exit 0, 96 of 96 cases in
  465.3 s from 01:33:26Z.
- **For `WSL-67`'s Nix work, on 2026-09-14:** in `docker.io/nixos/nix:latest`, Nix
  2.35.2, a new unprivileged account installed 16 names through flakes in 24 s and again
  in 10 s; a `nix-env` account through channels in 9 s; 25 of 25 table attributes
  evaluate.
- **WSL networking:** NAT mode, host address `172.23.96.1`, read by `wsl-toolkit
  hostaddress`. Two distributions share one network namespace, in `WSL-68`.
- **herdr:** 0.9.0 is the latest stable release, published 2026-09-07, read on
  2026-09-13. `herdr-linux-x86_64` is 24,644,488 bytes and
  `herdr-windows-x86_64.zip` 9,054,745 bytes, each with a published SHA-256 digest.
- **Muse:** Meta's installer at `dev.meta.ai` still has the approved digest, 9,314
  bytes, on 2026-09-14; the public channel serves `1.2.1-R2847.1`, a 299,251,896-byte
  Linux x86 build that answers without credentials.
- **For `WSL-71`:** on the throwaway `m71`, with automount off WSL starts a command in
  the account's home; with it on, in the Windows directory.
- **For `WSL-67`'s BSD drives:** NetBSD 11.0 and OpenBSD 7.9 are the current releases,
  read from the mirrors on 2026-09-14. QEMU 11.1.0 here has no `sga` device; with no
  disk, SeaBIOS's banner and boot messages reached `-serial stdio` under `-M
  q35,graphics=off` and under an `etc/sercon-port` fw_cfg file, and nothing did under a
  plain `-M q35`, on 2026-09-15.

## Found, and not filed

1. ⛔ `repo mutate` never runs a row's cases unmutated, so a case already red
   reports "went red".
2. ⛔ The gate's `powershell` check cannot fail: its producer uses pipe
   separators and its Go reader looks for tabs. Until fixed, parse every edited
   PowerShell file independently.
3. ⛔ `scripts/common/check.ps1` resolves the repository from the working
   directory rather than its own location.
4. `bootstrap.sh --dry-run --toolset agent --codegraph none --json` exits 1 on
   Debian 13; its cause has not been read.
5. A deterministic regression for pre-marker base rollback is still owed.
6. The generated manual prints a one-letter flag as `--c`, which the parser
   accepts and no example writes.
7. `examples/muse-code/README.md` and `examples/common/zellij.md` describe Zellij
   and `wsl-toolkit-muse`, which changes with `WSL-76`.
8. ⚠ **An ephemeral job says its output is kept, and it is not.** `run
   --container-lifecycle ephemeral` against `golang:1.25` printed `the complete
   output is kept: wsl-toolkit logs 4e94faa38b4c9c1c`; `logs` on that id answered
   exit 2, `no transcript`, and `jobs\4e94faa38b4c9c1c` was not in the state
   directory. Measured on 2026-09-14, and not yet read in the code.
9. ⚠ **A cancelled `bsd run` is reported as a budget that ran out.** Read in
   `bsd.go` on 2026-09-14 and not measured: a cancelled context ends the boot's wait
   with `the guest did not reach a login prompt within` the budget, and a command's
   with `the guest did not finish the command within the budget`, both exit 2, where
   `distro run` answers a cancellation with 130.
10. ⚠ **A base build fails when one Arch mirror stalls, and nothing retries.** Two
    `base ensure` builds from nothing on 2026-09-14 failed in `pacman` with
    `geo.mirror.pkgbuild.com : Operation too slow`, and each rolled its distribution
    back; the next attempt passed.
11. ⚠ **`wsl-toolkit-podbox` has every drive mounted `9p rw`**, read on 2026-09-14,
    and no configuration of its own, so it answers to the default `ro`. Its next
    `base ensure` provisions it again. It is not this session's to change.
12. ⚠ **23 more lines in nine files name an error by the first line of a guest
    command's stderr**, where wsl.exe can write a line of its own first: `adapters.go`,
    `base.go`, `cleanup_run.go`, `engine.go`, `inspect.go`, `job.go`, `matrix.go`,
    `resources.go` and `throwaway.go`, found by `WSL-85`'s door sweep on 2026-09-15.
    `WSL-85` fixed the verifier's; none of the others was measured naming a wsl.exe
    line.
13. A base built from nothing with automount and interop off printed 93 `wsl: Failed
    to translate` lines between provisioning and its restart, measured on 2026-09-15.
    Read, not measured: `appendWindowsPath=false` takes effect at that restart.
14. The verifier's `interop on` checks nothing, so a base configured with interop on
    over a guest without it verifies. Read on 2026-09-15, not measured, and it grants
    no authority.

## Review findings

Each closed entry carries its three reviews. `WSL-85`'s door sweep found 23 more
error messages named by a guest's first stderr line, recorded above; its claim audit
corrected the manual's first draft, which said a disagreeing base "answers exit 1" and
named no command. `WSL-67`'s checkpoint: the claim audit found the Nix version probe
outside `nix_run`, where the documentation said every Nix command gets the settings, and
the probe now goes through it; its closing reviews are still owed.

## Open questions for the operator

The download approval above. The later Muse session still needs the operator to run
`muse login`.

## Host state

- Registered distributions: `podman-machine-default`, `eph-pgb`, `wsl-toolkit` and
  `wsl-toolkit-podbox`, as at the session's start. `eph-pgb` keeps its disk under
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\wsl-ephemeral` and is not this tool's.
- ⭐ **No throwaway is left.** `wsl-toolkit-p67` and the acceptance runner's
  `wsl-toolkit-accp` and `wsl-toolkit-acc` were removed, with their state under `.tmp`.
- `instances` under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\wsl-toolkit` holds `acc`, `muse`, `nobase`,
  `podbox` and `podbox-migrate`, as at the start. `instances\muse` holds nothing.
- No BSD image is downloaded. The shared FreeBSD image is the published one,
  6,476,638,208 bytes, SHA-256 `12807CE7…921663BF`, not booted this session.
- herdr 0.9.0 is installed on Windows by the operator. `%USERPROFILE%\bin` holds no
  `muse.exe`.
- The dedicated SSH key the ruling allows is at
  `%USERPROFILE%\.ssh\wsl-toolkit\id_ed25519`, with an empty `known_hosts` beside it,
  and stays for `wsl-toolkit-base`. `%USERPROFILE%\.ssh\config` reads SHA-256
  `18FC11BE…E93F4`, as at the last session's end.
